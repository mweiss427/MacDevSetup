# Mac Developer Scripts
This is a collection of scripts to have a clean and orderly desktop.  

The problem that this solves is the day-to-day management and organization of a developer's desktop.  To where the code is to what tools are installed this will be a fully automated process to take a blank mac-os computer and turn it into an automated development environment.
